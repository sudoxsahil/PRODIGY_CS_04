# 🖥️ Task-04: Simple Keylogger (Educational Use Only)

This is Task-04 of my Cybersecurity Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

The goal is to create a basic keylogger that captures keyboard strokes and logs them to a file. This is done **only for ethical learning and demonstration purposes**.

## 🚀 Features

- Captures all keystrokes
- Logs special keys (ENTER, SPACE, etc.)
- Saves output to `key_log.txt`

Using keyloggers without consent is **illegal** and violates ethical standards.

## 🖥️ How to Run

### ▶️ Install the required library:
bash
pip install pynput

▶️ Run the script:

bash
python3 keylogger.py

✅ Output:
All keys will be logged to a file named key_log.txt in the same directory.
